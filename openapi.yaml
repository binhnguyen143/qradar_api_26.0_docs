                    \ received from an unknown source, each log source type that is\
                    \ eligible for autodetection attempts to parse the event in ascending\
                    \ order of precedence. Lower values are attempted before greater\
                    \ values.\n\n  minimum_successful_events - Number - The minimum\
                    \ number of events  collected from a source that must be successfully\
